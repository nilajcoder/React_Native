Create Different Text Format


Insert Image using Image Component
Use require for local Image and Uri for Online Pic



✨ Key Learnings:
require() ➝ Used to display local images from the project folder.
uri ➝ Used to fetch and show online images via URL.
Styling images with height, width, borderRadius, borderColor, and borderWidth makes them look clean and professional.
🖼️ I created a small demo where I displayed:
 ✔ A local React logo using require
 ✔ An online image using uri
 ✔ Applied rounded corners & borders for better UI
