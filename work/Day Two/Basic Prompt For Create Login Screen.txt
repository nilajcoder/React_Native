Generate a modern, professional React Native login screen using React Native CLI (not Expo).

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:

Use a functional component with hooks.

Layout:

App logo (center-top, remote image from Google).

Main heading: "Welcome Back ðŸ‘‹" (large, bold, stylish font).

Subheading: "Sign in to continue" (smaller, gray text).

Form inputs:

Email TextInput (with validation: required + proper email format).

Password TextInput with show/hide toggle icon (using react-native-vector-icons).

Smooth focus animations (slight border/highlight when active).

Actions:

Forgot Password? text (right-aligned, tappable).

Login button (rounded, gradient-like effect using backgroundColor, no gradient library).

Divider with OR.

Social login buttons: Google (red icon) + Facebook (blue icon).

Footer:

Bottom text: "Donâ€™t have an account? Sign Up" (clickable, highlight color).

Styling:

Use flexbox for responsive design.

Colors: White background, primary blue accent, light gray inputs.

Rounded corners, shadows, padding for a clean Material UI-like feel.

Use KeyboardAvoidingView to handle keyboard overlap.

Code quality:

Use separate StyleSheet for styles.

Follow best practices (proper naming, clean code, comments).

Avoid third-party gradient packages.
