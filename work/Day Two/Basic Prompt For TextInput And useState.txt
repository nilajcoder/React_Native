Generate a React Native functional component using React Native CLI (not Expo).

Requirements:

Use useState to manage input states for:

Name

Email

Phone Number

Password (with secureTextEntry).

Create four TextInput fields for these values.

Add a submit Button that, when pressed, will display all entered values below the form using Text.

Apply simple styling:

Inputs should have border, padding, margin, and rounded corners.

Container should have padding and center alignment.
